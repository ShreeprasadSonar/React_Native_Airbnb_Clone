We had originally wanted to get a ski condo, but we realized that we could not take proper care of the house and our guests if we didn't live nearby.  So instead we purchased this house in May 2013.  At the time, we didn't think we would use it much ourselves, but we do.  \r\n\r\nBetween renters, often while the maid is there, we drive down and hang out at the house.  We relax in the jacuzzi, where the only sound we can hear is the bubbles. We also enjoy swimming, foosball and shooting pool. From the house, it is an easy bike ride down to the beach and the bay (but a wicked ride back up the hill.)  I'm really into the outdoors, and I row on Mission Bay four days a week.  I also kayak (both ocean and bay), rollerblade, boogie board, swim masters and love hiking.  I love helping people find interesting outdoor activities.  \r\n\r\nI have three children, 14, 17 and 19.  The 18 year old is in NY at Columbia.  The 17 year old is a year ahead at school, and will be graduating this year.  She works at the Pacific Athletic Club's daycare and summer camps.  She was there this summer and is working part-time during the school year.   So if you need a babysitter, she can handle anything.  If you need a babysitter who is fluent in Spanish, Russian or Mandarin, she has friends.  My son just swam the 2+ mile swim from La Jolla Cove to La Jolla Shores and back.

Violations of the terms of this agreement may result in fines from 500.00 up to three (3) times the rental amount, as well as forfeiture of security deposits and immediate termination of occupancy with no refunds. All adult groups must be approved by owner prior to finalizing reservations.  As opposed to a hotel room, vacation rentals typically have more square feet, bedrooms, mechanical systems, appliances, electronics, etc. Because of this, there is a much greater chance that something may need attention during your stay and we promise to do everything within reason to remedy the situation; however we do not offer refunds unless the home is determined to be uninhabitable.      Please do not proceed with booking if you, or anyone in your group, are not comfortable with these policies. **** TERMS AND CONDITIONS Guest agrees to read and abide by the Term", "thumbnail_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/94a8400b-6d3d-444c-a02d-d2b52380f264.jpg?aki_policy=small", "medium_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/94a8400b-6d3d-444c-a02d-d2b52380f264.jpg?aki_policy=medium", "picture_url": null, "xl_picture_url": "https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/94a8400b-6d3d-444c-a02d-d2b52380f264.jpg?aki_policy=x_large", "host_id": "38690778", "host_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/38690778", "host_name": "Bluewater Vacation Homes", "host_since": "2015-07-16", "host_location": "San Diego, California, United States", "host_about": "Bluewater Vacation Homes is professional vacation rental agency in coastal San Diego.
